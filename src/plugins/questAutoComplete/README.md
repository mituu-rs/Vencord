# QuestCompleter

Automatically completes Discord quests for you.

Based on the original work by [aamiaa](https://github.com/aamiaa) - [Discord Quest Script](https://gist.github.com/aamiaa/204cd9d42013ded9faf646fae7f89fbb)

## Usage

**Enable Auto Start** in plugin settings to automatically complete quests when you accept them, or use the **Vencord Toolbox** button (top-right) → "Complete Active Quest" to manually trigger completion.

## Supported Quest Types

- ✅ Video Quests
- ✅ Game Quests
- ✅ Stream Quests
- ✅ Activity Quests

## Settings

Configure which quest types to auto-complete and notification preferences in the plugin settings.

## Notes

- Game and Stream quests require the official Discord desktop app (not browser or Vesktop)
- For stream quests, you need at least 1 other person in the voice channel
- This plugin requires the VencordToolbox plugin to be enabled for manual triggering
